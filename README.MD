# Bottle Dominate  PDF Playground

This is not real project, it is more playground where I tried to make some combination with **bottle framework** and **dominate**
library to avoid using HTML templates. So you are writing only Python code for all, models, controllers and views.
I didn't consider about performance and efficiency because, at the moment, I don't think that this will have mass usage.
The other thing is playing with various PDF generator libraries, such as **pdfkit**, **xhtml2pdf**, **PyPDF** and some other.
I based on those which generates PDF from HTML.

For those who finds it interesting and want try to involve, feel free to fork and try to improve it better than me.
Requirements:

```bash
pip install bottle dominate pdfkit PyPDF xhtml2pdf geraldo reportlab
```
